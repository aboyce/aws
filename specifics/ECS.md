## Elastic Container Service (ECS)

Fully managed container orchestration service that makes it easy for you to deploy, manage, and scaled containerised applications. These could be standard micro-service architectures, batch jobs for machine learning applications, and moving existing applications into the cloud.

### Management

Deployment, scheduling, scaling, and management of the containerised applications is handled by Elastic Container Service (ECS).

Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a way of running a managed Kubernetes in AWS.

Fargate is a serverless, pay-as-you-go compute engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers. It is compatible with both ECS and EKS.

### Hosting

The containers run on EC2 for ECS.

### Image Repository

The docker images can be stored in Amazons Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
