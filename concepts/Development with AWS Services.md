## Development with AWS Services

### AWS S3

A bucket is part of a global namespace that you create, the name is unique across the entire region.

An object is a file or an object that you put inside of a bucket. It is made up of a:

- Key
- Version Id
- Size

ACLs are used to grant permissions at the object or bucket level.

A bucket policy is a resource based AWS IAM access policy, you add a policy to a bucket to grant other IAM accounts or users permissions to S3 resources.
